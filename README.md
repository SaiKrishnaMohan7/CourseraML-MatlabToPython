# CourseraML-MatlabToPython
Converting scripts from Matlab to Python to have a better grip on Python

## Framework Source
* [This](https://github.com/mstampfer/Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python) is what I used to get a structure

* However, the above is in Python 2.7 and this repo holds python 3 code

## Experience
* This endeavour was way harder than I thought it'd be, was fun nevertheless.
* Quite a few exercises here aren't at par with their MATLAB counterparts as I need to bolster my understanding of this eco-system. There were a few things that I couldn't even get to
* I believe that this exercise was necessary as a push into the eco-system, whetting my apetite
* As I improve upon my understanding of this space, I think the gaps will fill up
* I was comparing all the scripts, as I wrote them, to my MATLAB scripts. They acted as my main source for the solutions
* SciPy and NumPy documentaions were very helpful and so was stack overflow
* A lot of google search was required for all this and really helped me in getting to the end
