# ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
# Instructions: You should complete the code by working through the
#               following parts.
#
# Part 1: Feedforward the neural network and return the cost in the
#         variable J. After implementing Part 1, you can verify that your
#         cost function computation is correct by verifying the cost
#         computed in ex4.m
#
# Part 2: Implement the backpropagation algorithm to compute the gradients
#         Theta1_grad and Theta2_grad. You should return the partial derivatives of
#         the cost function with respect to Theta1 and Theta2 in Theta1_grad and
#         Theta2_grad, respectively. After implementing Part 2, you can check
#         that your implementation is correct by running checkNNGradients
#
#         Note: The vector y passed into the function is a vector of labels
#               containing values from 1..K. You need to map this vector into a 
#               binary vector of 1's and 0's to be used with the neural network
#               cost function.
#
#         Hint: We recommend implementing backpropagation using a for-loop
#               over the training examples if you are implementing it for the 
#               first time.
#
# Part 3: Implement regularization with the cost function and gradients.
#
#         Hint: You can implement this around the code for
#               backpropagation. That is, you can compute the gradients for
#               the regularization separately and then add them to Theta1_grad
#               and Theta2_grad from Part 2.
